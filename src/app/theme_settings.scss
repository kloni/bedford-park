/// Theme settings can be changed here
/// Reference url: https://github.com/shakacode/sass-resources-loader
///
/// 1. Change theme path in app.scss
/// 2. Change theme path in theme_settings.scss which will be automatically imported into each component
/// ex. change _default in '_scss/_themes/_default/_settings.scss' to _hotdog theme - '_scss/_themes/_hotdog/_settings.scss' 
///
/// Warning
///
///
/// 1. Do not include anything that will be actually rendered in CSS, because it will be added to every imported SASS file.
/// 2. Avoid using SASS @import rules inside resources files as it slows down incremental builds. Add imported files 
///    directly in sassResources array in webpack config instead. If you concerned about location of your resources 
///    index, you might want to check out the solution outlined in this comment.
/// 3. If you still want to use SASS @imports make sure your paths are relative to the file they defined in 
///    (basically, your file with resources), except the ones started with ~ (~ is resolved to node_modules folder).
